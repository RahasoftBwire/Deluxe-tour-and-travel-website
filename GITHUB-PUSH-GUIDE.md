# 🔐 GitHub Push Authentication Guide

## Problem: Permission Denied (403 Error)

You're trying to push to `RahasoftBwire/Deluxe-tour-and-travel-website` but authenticated as `Crypt-Analyst`.

## ✅ SOLUTION: Use Personal Access Token

### Step 1: Generate GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to: **https://github.com/settings/tokens**
2. Click: **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Settings:
   - **Note:** `Deluxe Tour Website Push`
   - **Expiration:** 90 days (or your preference)
   - **Scopes:** ✅ Check `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
4. Click: **"Generate token"**
5. **COPY THE TOKEN** immediately (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Update Git Remote URL

Option A: **Use HTTPS with Token in URL** (Temporary)
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Afronic\Desktop\Deluxe tour and travel website"
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/RahasoftBwire/Deluxe-tour-and-travel-website.git
git push origin main
```

Option B: **Use Git Credential Manager** (Recommended)
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Afronic\Desktop\Deluxe tour and travel website"
git push origin main
```
When prompted:
- Username: `RahasoftBwire`
- Password: `YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (paste the token, not your GitHub password)

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Afronic\Desktop\Deluxe tour and travel website"
