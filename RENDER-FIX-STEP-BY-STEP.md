# 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX: Your Site Shows "Not Found"

## ⚡ THE PROBLEM

Your `render.toml` file is pushed to GitHub, but **Render doesn't automatically read it for existing services**. You must **manually update the dashboard settings**.

---

## ✅ STEP-BY-STEP FIX (5 MINUTES)

### Step 1: Open Render Dashboard
🔗 **Click here:** https://dashboard.render.com/

### Step 2: Find Your Service
- Look for: **"Deluxe-tour-and-travel-website"**
- Should show: "Static Site" badge
- Click on it to open

### Step 3: Click "Settings" Tab
- On the left sidebar or top menu
- Click **"Settings"**

### Step 4: Find "Build & Deploy" Section
Scroll down until you see:
```
Build & Deploy
├─ Root Directory: [blank or /]
├─ Build Command: [blank]
└─ Publish Directory: [BLANK] ← THIS IS THE PROBLEM!
```

### Step 5: Update Publish Directory
In the **"Publish Directory"** field, type:
```
frontend
```

**Important:** Just type `frontend` (no slash, no quotes)

### Step 6: Save Changes
- Scroll down to bottom of page
- Click the blue **"Save Changes"** button
- Wait for confirmation message

### Step 7: Manual Deploy
- Go back to main service page (click service name at top)
- Look for **"Manual Deploy"** button (usually top-right)
- Click dropdown arrow next to it
- Select: **"Deploy latest commit"**

### Step 8: Wait for Deploy
- You'll see logs scrolling
- Wait for: **"Your site is live 🎉"**
- Usually takes 1-2 minutes

### Step 9: Test Your Site
Open: https://deluxe-tour-and-travel-website.onrender.com

**You should now see your homepage!** 🎉

## 🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN SETTINGS

Before the fix:
```
Root Directory: [empty]
Build Command: [empty]
Publish Directory: [EMPTY] ← Problem is here!
```

After the fix:
```
Root Directory: [empty]
Build Command: [empty]
Publish Directory: frontend ← Fixed!
```

---

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

### ❌ DON'T Type:
- `/frontend` (with slash)
- `"frontend"` (with quotes)
- `./frontend` (with dot-slash)
- `Frontend` (capital F)

### ✅ DO Type:
- `frontend` (exactly like this)

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Can't find "Publish Directory" field
**Solution:** Make sure you're on the **Settings** page, not the main dashboard

### Problem: "Save Changes" button is grayed out
**Solution:** You need to actually type something in the Publish Directory field first

### Problem: Still shows "Not Found" after deploy
**Solution:** 
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Try incognito/private window
3. Check deploy logs for errors

### Problem: Render says "Build failed"
**Solution:** Check the logs. Since we're using static HTML, there should be NO build command. Make sure:
- Build Command: Leave EMPTY
- Publish Directory: `frontend`

## 📞 STILL STUCK?

### Alternative Solution: Redeploy from Scratch

If the above doesn't work, try this:

1. **Delete the current service** on Render
2. **Create a new Static Site**
3. Connect to GitHub: `RahasoftBwire/Deluxe-tour-and-travel-website`
4. Branch: `main`
5. **IMPORTANT:** When asked for settings:
   - Build Command: Leave empty
   - **Publish Directory: `frontend`** ← Set this during creation!
6. Click "Create Static Site"
7. Wait for deployment

This ensures the publish directory is set from the beginning.

## 🚀 ALTERNATIVE: Use Vercel Instead

If Render is too confusing, Vercel is easier:

```powershell
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
cd "c:\Users\Afronic\Desktop\Deluxe tour and travel website"
vercel --prod
```

When prompted:
- Set up and deploy? **Y**
- Scope: (your account)
- Link to existing? **N**
- Project name: `deluxe-tour-travel`
- Directory: **`./` (current)**
- Override settings? **Y**
- Build Command: (leave empty)
- Output Directory: **`frontend`**
- Development Command: (leave empty)

**Deploy time: 1 minute!**
**Your site will be at:** `https://deluxe-tour-travel.vercel.app`
