# Deployment Guide for Deluxe Tour and Travel Website

## 🚀 Render Deployment (Static Site)

Your site is deployed at: https://deluxe-tour-and-travel-website.onrender.com

### Issue: "Not Found" Error

**Problem:** Render doesn't know where to find your HTML files because they're in the `frontend` directory.

### ✅ Solution: Configure Render Properly

#### Option 1: Update Render Dashboard Settings

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your service: `Deluxe-tour-and-travel-website`
3. Go to **Settings**
4. Update these settings:

```
Build Command: (leave empty)
Publish Directory: frontend
```

5. Click **Save Changes**
6. Go to **Manual Deploy** → Click **Deploy latest commit**

---

#### Option 2: Use render.toml (Already Created)

I've created a `render.toml` file that tells Render:
- Publish directory is `frontend`
- How to handle routing
- Security headers
- Caching rules

**To apply:**
1. Commit the new `render.toml` file
2. Push to GitHub
3. Render will automatically redeploy with correct settings

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Afronic\Desktop\Deluxe tour and travel website"
git add render.toml GITHUB-PUSH-GUIDE.md
git commit -m "fix: Add Render configuration for static site deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 📋 Render Configuration Details

### Current Setup:
- **Type:** Static Site
- **Repository:** RahasoftBwire/Deluxe-tour-and-travel-website
- **Branch:** main
- **Root Directory:** (root)
- **Publish Directory:** frontend ← **THIS IS KEY**

### What render.toml Does:
```toml
publishDir = "frontend"  # Tells Render where HTML files are
```

---

## 🔧 Alternative: Restructure Project

If you prefer, you can move `index.html` to the root:

```powershell
# Copy index.html to root
copy frontend/index.html ./index.html

# Update paths in index.html
# Change: href="css/style.css"
# To: href="frontend/css/style.css"
```

But **I don't recommend this** - keeping frontend separate is cleaner.
