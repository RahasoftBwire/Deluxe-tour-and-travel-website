# ⚠️ Node.js Installation In Progress

## Current Status:
The `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` command is running in the background.
This may take 5-10 minutes depending on your internet speed.

## What to do:

### Option 1: Wait for Automatic Installation
The winget command should complete automatically. 
After it's done, close and reopen PowerShell, then run:
```powershell
node --version
npm --version
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation (Faster)
If the automatic installation is taking too long:

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: https://nodejs.org/
3. Click "Download Node.js (LTS)"
4. Run the installer (.msi file)
5. Follow the installation wizard (use default settings)
6. Click "Finish" when done
7. **Close and reopen PowerShell**
8. Verify installation:
   ```powershell
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

## After Node.js is Installed:

Run this command to install all dependencies:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Afronic\Desktop\Deluxe tour and travel website\backend"
npm install
```

Then start the servers:
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd "c:\Users\Afronic\Desktop\Deluxe tour and travel website\backend"
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd "c:\Users\Afronic\Desktop\Deluxe tour and travel website\frontend"
npx http-server -p 3000 -o
```

## What's Been Created While Waiting:

✅ All Database Models:
   - User.js (with password hashing)
   - Tour.js (with pricing and availability)
   - Booking.js (with payment tracking)
   - Review.js (verified reviews)
   - Contact.js (inquiry management)

✅ Ready to continue with:
   - Authentication APIs
   - Tour Management APIs
   - Booking System
   - Payment Integration
